# Concept Drift Detection forMultivariate Data Streams and Temporal Segmentation ofDaylong Egocentric Videos

This is the implementation of our paper titled "Concept Drift Detection for Multivariate Data Streams and Temporal Segmentation of Daylong Egocentric Videos"  in #ACMMM2020. We present a novel unsupervised temporal segmentation technique especially suited for day-long egocentric videos.



## Requirements
The code has been tested on:
 - Caffe Deep Learning Framework and matcaffe wrapper (for global features calculation)
		Caffe main page: http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/
		Good Linux installation tutorial: https://github.com/tiangolo/caffe/blob/ubuntu-tutorial-b/docs/install_apt2.md
		CaffeNet model: http://dl.caffe.berkeleyvision.org/bvlc_googlenet.caffemodel
  - Compile files in GCMex for your system.
	- MATLAB (2015 to 2019b)
	- Python 2.7
